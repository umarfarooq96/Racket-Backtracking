(subsets lst)
  lst: a list

  A choice expression which yields a subset of 'lst'.
  Repeated calls to 'next' should yield *all* other subsets
  (i.e., 'next' returns "false." only when all subsets of 'lst'
  have been returned).

  The subsets can be yielded in any order; however, no subset
  can appear twice.

  Note that:
    - A subset isn't the same as a sublist. Items don't have to be consecutive.
    - A subset can be empty; the empty set is a subset of any list.
    - Order doesn't matter in subsets
  
  The following is an example of how 'subsets' is used.
  Note that your implementation might yield the subsets
  in a different order than the one shown here.

> (subsets '(1 2))
'()
> (next)
'(1)
> (next)
'(2)
> (next)
'(1 2)
> (next)
"false."
;subsets of '(1 2 3) gives '((), (1), (2), (2 1), (3), (1 3), (2 3), (1 2 3))
(-< (first ^))
Good way to think about subsets:
 subsets of s = either has some element in s or doesn't have it
 so subsets of (2 3) either have 1 ((1) (2 1) (1 3) (1 2 3)) or don't (() (2) (3) (2 3))

(sudoku-4 puzzle)
  puzzle: a nested list representing a 4-by-4 Sudoku puzzle

  A choice expression that represents possible solutions to the puzzle.
  Upon evaluation, just one solution is returned, but repeated calls
  to 'next' produces more possible solutions, if any.

  Hint: use the ?- function in your solution. Again, your main task
  is just to correctly express the constraints, and let the computer
  do the work.

?- used like this: (?- (helper that checks if sudoku solution is valid) (get all sudoku possibilites))

Some thoughts:

A valid sudoku puzzle is valid iff it's rows, columns and cells are valid.
Valididity is given in the handout.

  combine: a binary function
  init: an initial value
  expr: a choice expression

  Evaluate all choices in <expr> and combine them, one at a time, with the
  initial value, and return the result.

  Note that the order of <combine>'s parameters is the same as foldl:
    1) The value of the next choice
    2) The value of <init>
